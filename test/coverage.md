## Coverage Commands

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Coverage by Test Type
```bash
# Unit test coverage
npm run test:unit -- --coverage

# Integration test coverage
npm run test:integration -- --coverage
```

## Critical Coverage Areas

### Must Have 100% Coverage
1. **Error Handling**: All error scenarios must be tested
2. **API Retry Logic**: All retry attempts and backoff
3. **Data Validation**: All input/output validation
4. **Security Functions**: Any security-related code

### Must Have >= 90% Coverage
1. **Core Business Logic**: API calls, data processing
2. **State Management**: Store actions and mutations
3. **Critical User Flows**: Loading, error recovery

### Must Have >= 80% Coverage
1. **Component Logic**: Vue component methods
2. **Utility Functions**: Helper functions
3. **Routing Logic**: Navigation and guards

## Coverage Monitoring

### CI/CD Integration
- Coverage reports are generated on every PR
- Build fails if coverage drops below minimum thresholds
- Coverage trends are tracked over time

### Coverage Badges
- README includes coverage badges
- Badges update automatically from CI

### Coverage Alerts
- Slack notifications for coverage drops
- Email alerts for critical coverage failures

## Improving Coverage

### Strategies for Low Coverage Areas

#### 1. Identify Uncovered Lines
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=html

# Open detailed report
open coverage/index.html
```

#### 2. Add Missing Tests
- Focus on untested branches
- Add edge case tests
- Test error conditions

#### 3. Remove Dead Code
- Identify unused functions
- Remove obsolete code paths
- Simplify complex conditions

### Test Quality over Quantity
- Meaningful tests over coverage percentage
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Focus on user-facing functionality

## Coverage Reports

### Daily Reports
- Automated coverage reports sent daily
- Track coverage trends
- Identify declining areas

### Release Reports
- Comprehensive coverage analysis before releases
- Documentation of any coverage exceptions
- Sign-off required for coverage below targets

## Coverage Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code
1. **Single Responsibility**: Functions do one thing
2. **Dependency Injection**: Easy to mock dependencies
3. **Pure Functions**: Predictable inputs/outputs
4. **Error Handling**: Explicit error cases

### Effective Testing
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
2. **Test Names**: Describe behavior being tested
3. **Mock Appropriately**: Mock external dependencies
4. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions

### Coverage Maintenance
1. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly coverage analysis
2. **Refactor Legacy**: Improve old untested code
3. **New Code**: 100% coverage for new features
4. **Documentation**: Update coverage docs

## Tools and Configuration

### Coverage Tools
- **Vitest**: Primary test runner with built-in coverage
- **V8**: Coverage provider for accurate reporting
- **Istanbul**: Alternative coverage tool if needed

### Reporting Formats
- **HTML**: Interactive browser reports
- **JSON**: Machine-readable for CI/CD
- **LCOV**: Integration with external tools
- **Text**: Quick terminal output

### Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated coverage in CI
- **Codecov**: External coverage tracking
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and coverage analysis

## Troubleshooting Coverage

### Common Issues
1. **Low Branch Coverage**: Add tests for all if/else paths
2. **Untested Functions**: Ensure all functions are called in tests
3. **Async Code**: Use proper async/await in tests
4. **Mock Issues**: Verify mocks don't hide real code

### Debug Coverage
```bash
# Run specific test with coverage
npx vitest run specific.test.ts --coverage

# Debug mode with coverage
npx vitest --ui --coverage
```

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Mutation Testing**: Verify test quality
2. **Performance Coverage**: Track test performance
3. **Visual Coverage**: Screenshot-based UI testing
4. **Accessibility Coverage**: A11y testing integration

### Tool Upgrades
- Migrate to newer coverage tools as available
- Integrate with advanced analysis platforms
- Automate coverage improvement suggestions
